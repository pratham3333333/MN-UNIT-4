## 📘 Topics Covered

### 1. Cloud Computing Elements

**Elements include:**
- Client Devices
- Cloud Infrastructure
- Applications/Services
- Cloud Platform
- Storage
- Network

**Diagram:**

```
[Client Devices] --> [Internet] --> [Cloud Platform]
                                       |-> Compute
                                       |-> Storage
                                       |-> Applications
```

**Example:** Using Google Drive on a phone = Client + Network + Storage in Cloud

### 4. Separation of Responsibility in Cloud

**Responsibility Table:**

| Component              | Cloud Provider | Customer |
|------------------------|----------------|----------|
| Hardware/Infra         | ✅             | ❌       |
| Virtualization         | ✅             | ❌       |
| OS                     | ⚠️             | ✅       |
| App/Data               | ❌             | ✅       |
